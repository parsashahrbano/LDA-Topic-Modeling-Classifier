This repository contains a Python-based script that uses the LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) algorithm for topic modeling and document classification. The script processes a collection of unrelated documents, groups them by similarity, and stores related documents in corresponding folders. The process continues until all documents are classified into their respective topics.
